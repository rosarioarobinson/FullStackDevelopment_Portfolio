# Full Stack Development I Portfolio for CS 465

## Architecture

### Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA). ###
When it comes to the various types of frontend development I utilized while building my full stack project, such as Express HTML, JavaScript, and SPA (or single-page application), each type provided similar yet different solutions to displaying information to the website. Express HTML is a straightforward framework that allows for Node JS to be able to display data to the web application. JavaScript, however, is a standard and well-known programming language that was utilized heavily throughout the full stack project to create the code needed to display the code via the Express framework. SPA, or single-page application, is the most recent and displayed in my most current branch. SPA works by allowing a faster load time for the user, while also essentially dealing with the framework via Angular, which is used throughout the code using router expressions. The main thing that these various types of development frameworks and languages utilized in my project have in common is that they all allow for various ways to display a full stack front-end web application. Although the methods vary, it allows for multi-uses, depending on the type of application a developer wishes to build.
    
### Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database? ###
The backend used a NoSQL MongoDB database because it's straightforward for us as developers to adjust to understand how to utilize a database. MongoDB essentially creates the database for you, and the ease of using MongoDB within the MEAN stack makes it manageable to store data while connecting to the front-end web stack. It also utilizes Mongoose, which is a JavaScript-based library that essentially works as the connection from MongoDB to the Express (and Angular in the case of using SPA) framework.
    

## Functionality

### How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces? ###
JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, essentially is simplified data that you can insert and read into the database. Since it is similar to inserting a query into a table, it is easy enough for developers to use to store various types of data. The way that JSON ties the front and back end together, is that due to the type of data it stores, it allows for the front end, particularly when using Express or JavaScript, to be able to interpret that into values or objects. 
    
### Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components. ###
Throughout the full stack process, I refactored code based on my understanding of various frameworks, and how they would improve functionality and efficiency in terms of load time for a user. For instance, I refactored the code to display from using Express HTML to SPA, where I used Angular to provide a faster and more easeful process of loading the web application. The SPA provides different frameworks like Angular which use routers to connect to various files and code throughout the project. Since Angular is still a JavaScript framework and uses TypeScript, it was easier to refactor the code to create a single-page application.
Reusing user interface components allows me to see those changes happening in real-time while refactoring the code and how different frameworks like Angular affect that UI and its load time.
    

## Testing

### Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application. ###
Understanding how to properly test the web application throughout its various stages was a learning curve. Understanding how to use localhost, connect to MongoDB, and tools like Postman were important to test the various ways of ensuring the application was properly connected. Understanding how to connect and get MongoDB online was the hardest to understand, but MongoDB Compass helps make that process easier. API endpoints that I used focused around my localhost, as it is one of the quickest and easiest ways to see if the website is up and running properly against my code. This was displayed via Visual Studio Codeâ€™s debugging program as well. As for Postman, they allow even further testing of your API by using methods like GET and POST to check the status of your connections.
    

## Reflection

### How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field? ###
This course has taught me a lot over the past eight weeks, especially how to use and manipulate various tools at the same time. I have heard of the MEAN stack before but implementing it was a whole different skill of its own. Specifically, understanding tools such as MongoDB and Angular I believe will be beneficial in my future career, as even if I go the route of full stack developer or software engineer, it is valuable to know various tools and frameworks under your belt.
